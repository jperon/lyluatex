The following changes may affect code that worked with v1.0f:

- ly_opts is not a global variable anymore but can be accessed
  through lua_options.client('ly') instead
- Replace macro \lysetoption with \setluaoption (from luaoptions package)
  \lysetoption{key}{value} should be replaced with
  \setluaoption{ly}{key}{value} in any documents/packages
- Extracted package `luaoptions` as separate repository
  (causing a number of follow-up changes)
