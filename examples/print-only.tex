\section*{Print only Selected Systems or Pages}

The \texttt{print-only} option allows to limit the printed systems or pages from
a score. A typical use case is to print a score interspersed with comments.  The
advantage of this approach is that the score is compiled only once while the
individual systems are simply reused by \LaTeX.

Throughout this document we'll demonstrate the different options to
select systems from the following score:

\lilypondfile[verbatim]{eight-systems.ly}

The simplest selection is a single system: \texttt{print-only=4}

\lilypondfile[print-only=4]{eight-systems.ly}

Ranges are also possible: \texttt{print-only=3-5}, with the special form of
\texttt{print-only=6-} which prints from the given system throughout the end of
the score. Negative ranges can be given with \texttt{print-only=7-5}

\lilypondfile[print-only=3-5]{eight-systems.ly}

\lilypondfile[print-only=6-]{eight-systems.ly}

\lilypondfile[print-only=7-5]{eight-systems.ly}

With a comma-separated list an arbitrary sequence of systems can be specified.
The list has to be enclosed in curly brackets: \texttt{print-only={4,1,2}}

\lilypondfile[print-only={4,1,2}]{eight-systems.ly}

Each element of the list can include any of the forms described above:\\
\texttt{print-only={3,5-7,4,7-}}

\lilypondfile[print-only={3,5-7,4,7-}]{eight-systems.ly}

The functionality is identical with fullpage scores where the selection applies
to \emph{pages} instead. This can for example be used when the “score” file
contains a number of individual pieces (e.g. songs for a song book), and
individual selections are to be printed.

Systems have some specific behaviour with regard to \emph{indent}, but this is demonstrated in its own file \texttt{dynamic-indent.tex}.
